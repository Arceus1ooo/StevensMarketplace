# STEVENS MARKETPLACE

Students attending Stevens often find it difficult to find specific items at affordable prices, or finding someone willing to buy an item that they no longer use. On a college campus, this situation occurs with items commonly found around most dormitories and off-campus apartments, as most items are only used while the student is attending the university. Stevens Marketplace enables students to buy and sell items at their own discretion on the platform.

Stevens Marketplace will focus on creating a website application where users can list textbooks, sports equipment, electronics, or furniture on the marketplace, as a seller. They can also pick what item they wish to purchase, as a buyer, and directly message the seller to set up a time and place where they can meet to finalize the transaction.
