# StevensMarketplace
### Team Members: Sebastian Muriel, Adefemi Fagbewesa, Julia Nelson, Gavin Snyder

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students attending Stevens often find it difficult to find specific items at affordable
prices, or finding someone willing to buy an item that they no longer use. On a college campus,
this situation occurs with items commonly found around most dormitories and off-campus
apartments, as most items are only used while the student is attending the university. Stevens
Marketplace enables students to buy and sell items at their own discretion on the platform.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stevens Marketplace will focus on creating a website application where users can list
textbooks, sports equipment, electronics, or furniture on the marketplace, as a seller. They can
also pick what item they wish to purchase, as a buyer, and directly message the seller to set up a
time and place where they can meet to finalize the transaction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By implementing this project, Stevens Marketplace hopes to ease the financial stress of
the Stevens students. This will also bring joy to those who no longer need to consider throwing
away their products. Now, users can recycle items they no longer use, reducing waste, while
being compensated at the same time.
